# Ghost Ping Detector Discord Bot

# Description:
The Ghost Ping Detector Discord Bot is a Python-based project aimed at enhancing user experience and moderating servers by identifying and displaying ghost ping messages within a Discord community. This project makes use of the Discord.py API to efficiently parse deleted messages for instances of user pings, subsequently presenting the deleted content if a ghost ping is detected.

# Features:

GhostPing Detection: The bot employs the power of the Discord.py API to actively scan deleted messages for occurrences of user pings, catching ghost pings in real-time.

Deleted Message Recovery: When a ghost ping is found, the bot intelligently retrieves and displays the deleted message.

Continuous Runtime: The bot is hosted using Replit, ensuring uninterrupted operation. The integration of Flask with UptimeRobot guarantees seamless uptime, enhancing reliability.
